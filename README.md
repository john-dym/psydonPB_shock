GMOD TTT Addon to physically shock innocent players
The GMOD addon will output the death messages to a txt file (shock.txt). The text file will be parsed by a Python script. The Python script will check if a player deserves a shock (when a innocent kills a innocent). It will then communicate to an ESP8266 microcontroller that is connected via USB who is acting as a server. That server will contact the appropriate ESP8266 microcontroller client via the built in WIFI. The client is connected to a dog bark shock collar that the player is wearing. When it recieves the data from the server it will activate the collar and shock the player.
